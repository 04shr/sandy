                    <p>✨🎂 Happy Birthday! 🎂✨ Wishing you a bright and successful future filled with endless opportunities and achievements. As you move forward in life, always remember: <br>
                        1️⃣ Believe in Yourself 💪 – Stay confident and trust your abilities. Don’t get confused by distractions; choose a goal that excites you and brings you happiness. When you truly enjoy what you do, success will naturally follow. 🌟<br>
                        2️⃣ Stay Focused & Determined 🎯 – Pick one meaningful goal and give it your best effort. Constantly changing paths can slow progress, so commit to something you love and keep growing in it. 🚀<br>
                        3️⃣ Stay Calm & Resilient 🌿 – Life will have ups and downs, but don’t let tough times stress you. Learn from challenges, stay patient, and never let past mistakes hold you back. Every setback is a lesson, and every challenge makes you stronger. <br>

                    <p>Happy birthday sandyaaaaaaaaaaa 😋💗 <br>
                        I wish I knew what I got myself into back then in 10th std when we met because damnn i’m lucky to have found you(not once but twice🙂‍↕️). The fact that we are from different schools and different colleges and still made it here is so special. Imagine showing our photo to our kids one day and they go like “why are you both wearing different uniforms?”…we’ll have a long ass story to tell them🥹 <br>
                        Anyway, thankyou for bringing my other side out(even if you dont think so,if you see this video you will definitely believe that my other side comes out with yours and shreya’s presence). Thank you for always making everyone happy ,even if you’re sad. <br>
                        You’re one of a kind and you inspire me everyday with your bravery and courage even if you don’t think about yourself in a positive manner.

                    <p>  I hope you know that you’re a lot MORE than what you think of yourself as  ;)💗
                        You’re finally turning 20. I’m hope we get to have lotsss of fun and happy memories. Keep slaying like you always do 💗💗</p> <br> <br>

                        All those cafe hopping, movie nights where we forget to watch movie and just talk, and crazy trip where we made so many memories 
                        I hope this year is gonna be more memorable for you✨ <br>

                        We’ve been stuck with each other since the 7th grade. We’ve definitely had our ups *and* downs. But we’re still sticking with each other, right? You’ll always be my girl (you & Akshaya🫂). <br>
                        
                        You underestimate yourself a lot. You don’t like the way you look sometimes. But let me tell you, you are one of the *most* prettiest persons I’ve ever met. Both outside and inside. I mean it. <br>
                        
                        Even if we ain’t talking every day, you’re still my best friend and nothing’s gonna change that. I’m always gonna be your hype girl, your supporter💖🫶         <br>              
                        Happy birthday bitch <3</p>
